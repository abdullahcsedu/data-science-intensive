The more features the algorithm has available, the more potential there is for a complex fit. We will explore this in detail in the “Feature Selection” lesson, but you’ll get a sneak preview now.\n",
    "What's the number of features in your data? (Hint: the data is organized into a numpy array where the number of rows is the number of data points and the number of columns is the number of features; so to extract this number, use a line of code like len(features_train[0]).)"
